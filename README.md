growth_rate_msmt_and_taphon_correction
======================================

This depository contains code for illustrations in a submitted Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory manuscript, addressing best practice in extracting demographic information from archaeological and paleontological temporal frequency distributions. In particular, a proportional growth rate, the 'equivalent growth rate,' is recommended, identical in calculation to the calculation of r-bar in formal demography. This measure is surprisingly resilient against multiple ocnfounding sources of error, and the illustrations coded here are offered in an article in support of this claim.
